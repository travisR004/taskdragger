Re-creation of Trello!

Server Side: Rails
Frontend: Backbone

Task management site for organizing projects (re-creation of Trello). Created a custom CompositeView extension from the backbone View to handle rendering of multiple collections on one page. Utilized JQuery UI so users can organize tasks by dragging and dropping the lists and cards to their desired position on the board.
